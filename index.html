            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <h2>About This Class</h2>
            <p>Audacity is an open source, free and easy to use audio editor and recorder. It includes powerful audio post-production tools to help create professional podcasts and music.</p>
            <p>This class introduces the basic concepts and interface of Audacity. By the end of the class, you will gather basic knowledge of how to import, record, edit and export your audio project with Audacity. Some more advanced editing tools will also be mentioned such as <em>auto duck</em> and <em>noise reduction</em>. You will also have the opportunity to record or use our excercise file to create your own podcast. We encourage you explore Audacity's other advanced features that are briefly mentioned at the end of this class. </p>

            <h2>Download Audacity</h2>
            <img class="center" src="images/logo.jpg" alt="audacity logo with name">
            <p>Go to <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org">www.audacityteam.org</a> and download the newest version of Audacity. The version we use for this class is Audacity 2.2.2. Then install Audacity by following the basic procedure of your computer operating system. </p>

            <h2>Download the Class Files</h2>
            <p>From the STS Canvas Course Homepage, download the Class Files for Audacity. These will help you complete the exercise below!</p>

            <h1>Navigating the Workspace</h1>
            <p>When you open Audacity, it will automatically create a new project for you. If you want to create an additional new project, go to <strong>File > New</strong></p>
            <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/audacity-interface.png" alt="image of audacity interface"> </div>

            <h2>Import Audio</h2>
            <p>Let's go ahead and import some audio! There are two ways to do this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Navigate to <span class="highlight-type">File > Open...</span> to import your audio file. If you want to import multiple audio files, this will create an new individual project for each audio file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Navigate to <span class="highlight-type">File > Import > Audio...</span> to import your audio file. If you want to import multiple audio files, this will import all of them into your current existing project.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For this exercise, let's use <span class="highlight-type">File > Import > Audio...</span> to import the <strong>voiceover file</strong> and <strong>melodyloops-season-of-joy file</strong> from our downloaded Class Files into the same project.</p>

            <p> Audacity will prompt you how do you want to import your audio, we recommand you choose <strong>Make a copy of the files before editing (safer)</strong>. Audacity will keep the original files untouched so that you have a backup if anything goes wrong. Click OK once you have made your selection.</p>

            <div class="tool-reference">
                <h3>Selection Tool</h3>
                <img src="images/icon-selection.png" alt="selection tool icon">
                <p>The default tool of Audacity. Use it to select, or highlight, any part of the audio to edit it.</p>

                <p>Press the View Fit Tool icon and Audacity will automatically rescale your entire audio file(s) to fit your project window.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Recording Audio</h2>
            <p>The other way to gather audio is to record it yourself directly in Audacity! To do this, make sure you have access to a <strong>microphone</strong> or a <strong>computer with an internal microphone </strong>(such as Mac laptops). Let's start recording by following these easy steps:</p>
            <h3>First, test your microphone level</h3>
            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>
                    <p> Find the <strong>microphone level bar</strong> at the top right of the interface, and <strong>click to start monitoring</strong>. </p>
                    <div class="center-text">
                        <img class="large" src="images/microphone-level-bar.gif" alt="gif showing microphone level bar in use">
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Speak in your normal speaking voice</strong> to test the level, make sure your sound level locates at about <strong>-6 dB</strong>. This level helps prevent audio to go over 0 dB which often results in audio distortion, something that cannot be fixed in post production
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p> If your mic level is too low or too high, or cannot see the shifting green bar, you can change your voice volume, or adjust the microphone sensibilit on the top left.</p>
                    <img class="center" src="images/microphone-sensibility.gif" alt="gif showing how to change microphone sensibility">
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Start Recording</h3>
            <p>Choose the type of the microphone you want to use for recording. In this case, I am using the Internal Microphone directly from my laptop.</p>
            <img src="images/record-mtype.png" alt="microphone selection">
            <div class="tool-reference">
                <h3>Record Tool</h3>
                <img src="images/icon-record.png" alt="record tool icon">
                <p>Click on the Record Tool to start recording in a new track. Press the Pause Tool to take a break while recording, or Stop Tool once you finish recording.</p>

            <h1>Audio Effects</h1>
            <p>Audacity includes many audio effects for more advanced audio editing. To apply an effect, first use the <strong>Selection Tool</strong> to highlight the area of the audio you want to modify. Then, from the <strong>Effect Menu</strong>, select an effect option to add to the selected audio.</p>
            <h2>Basic Audio Effects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight-type">Effect > <strong>Amplify...</strong></span>: Increases or decreases the volume of the selected audio </li>
                <li><span class="highlight-type">Effect > <strong>Change Speed...</strong></span>: Increases or decreases the speed of the selected audio , affecting the pitch in the process </li>
                <li><span class="highlight-type">Effect > <strong>Change Pitch...</strong></span>: Changes the degree of highness or lowness of the tone in the selected audio</li>
                <li><span class="highlight-type">Effect > <strong>Change Tempo...</strong></span>: Changes the speed at which the selected audio is played without affecting the pitch</li>
                <li><span class="highlight-type">Effect > <strong>Fade In/Fade Out...</strong></span>: In addition to the Fade Tool, you can also use this effect to automatically fade the audio</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Advanced Audio Effects</h2>
            <p>There are many powerful audio effects in Audacity. This section will mainly focus on how to use the <strong>Noise Reduction</strong> Effect and <strong>Auto Duck</strong> Effect.</p>
            <h3>Noise Reduction</h3>
            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>
                    <p>Record your own audio, or import the <strong>noise-reduction.wav</strong> file from the downloaded Class Files into your project</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use the <strong>Selection Tool</strong> to highlight some "empty" space between words within the recorded speech. This selection will be the reference point for Audacity to know what noise to filter out once we apply the effect.</p>
                    <img class="center" src="images/effects-choosenoise.png" alt="example of selecting empty space between words within the audio">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Go to <span class="highlight-type">Effect > <strong>Noise Reduction...</strong></span> and click <em>Get Noise Profile</em></p>
                    <img src="images/effect-noise-profile.PNG " alt="noise reduction dialogue box with get noise profile button ">
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using the <strong>Selection Tool</strong>, highlight all of the audio you want to reduce background noise from, and go to <span class="highlight-type">Effect > <strong>Noise Reduction</strong></span> again
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Increase the <strong>Noise reduction (dB)</strong> to filter out more background noise. Keep in mind that if you choose to filter out too much noise, the audio might become distorted. Always make sure to <strong>Preview</strong> your effect before hitting <strong>OK</strong>
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/effect-noise-reduction.PNG" alt="noise reduction dialogue box with editing options">

            <img src="images/effects-before.png " alt="example of audio wavelengths before noise reduction ">
            <h4>After Noise Reduction:</h4>
            <img src="images/effects-after.png " alt="example of audio wavelengths after noise reduction ">

            <h3>Auto Duck</h3>
            <p>Auto Duck is an especially useful effect for podcasting. The effect reduces (ducks) the volume of one or more selected tracks automatically whenever the volume of a single unselected "control track " placed underneath reaches a particular threshold level. For example, you can have the volume of the track with background music reduce once the track with a voiceover is introduced at a certain volume.</p>
            <ol class="instruction-list ">
                <li>
                    <p>Import the music file <span class="highlight-type"><strong>melodyloops-season-of-joy.mp3</strong></span> and <span class="highlight-type"><strong>voiceover.wav</strong></span> file. Make sure the music file is on the track above the track of the voiceover file. If not, click on the <strong>small triangle next to the audio name</strong>, and choose <em>Move Track Down</em></p>
                    <img src="images/move-track-down.gif" alt="gif showing how to move a track below another one">
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using the <strong>Selection Tool</strong>, highlight the entire music file and go to <span class="highlight-type">Effect > <strong>Auto Duck</strong></span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Adjust the <strong>Duck amount</strong> and <strong>outer and inner fade up/fade down length</strong>. The lower the dB of the <strong>Duck amount</strong>, the lower the volume of the music will be once the voiceover appears. The <strong>Outer fade down/up length</strong> is the amount of time it takes to gradually fade the music out or in before the voice audio enters. The inner fade down/up length is the amount of time given to continue the fade after the voice audio enters. Remeber to always <strong>Preview</strong> your edits before clicking OK.</p>
                    <img src="images/effect-autoduck.png" alt="auto duck dialogue box with editing options">
                </li>
                <li>
                    Press <strong>OK</strong> once you're done. Below is an example of a music file before and after the Auto Duck Effect:

            <h1>Saving and Exporting</h1>
            <p>When you finish working with your audio files, you have several options for saving and exporting your files. </p>

            <h2>Save as Audacity Project</h2>
            <div class="side-image-large "> <img src="images/saving-audacityproject.png " alt="image of file > save project as..."> </div>
            <p>Saving as an Audacity project allows you to open the project later and add further changes to your audio. The information of your multiple tracks will be saved into the project. This is the best option if you want to <strong>continue editing in Audacity</strong>. Note that this project is only compatible with Audacity, meaning you won't be able to share your creation with people who don't have Audacity downloaded onto the computer they want to open your project from.</p>

            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>
                    Go to <span class="highlight-type">File > <strong>Save Project...</strong></span>

                <li>
                    <strong>Choose a folder</strong> to save your project in. The default folder is named Audacity and is usually placed under Documents.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Give your project an appropriate <strong>File Name</strong> so that it is easier to locate later in case you forget the folder it's saved in.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click <strong>Save</strong> to save your project as a <span class="highlight-type">.aup</span> file</li>
            </ol>
