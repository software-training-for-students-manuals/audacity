            </ol>

        </div>



        <h2>Opening a New Project</h2>
        <p>When you open Audacity, it will automatically create a new project for you. If you want to create an additional new project, go to <strong>File > New</strong></p>
        <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/audacity-interface.png" alt="image of audacity interface"> </div>

        <h2>Import Audio</h2>
        <p>Go to <span class="highlight-type">File > Import > Audio...</span> to bring in your audio file(s) to work with. To import multiple audio files at once, hold down <kbd>Command</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd> and click on each file you'd like to use in your Audacity project.</p>

        <div class="good-to-know center">
            <p>Note that if you go to <strong>File > Open</strong> and select audio files, they will open in separate audacity projects instead of a single project. To ensure all audio files import into one project, make sure you go to <strong>File > Import > Audio...</strong> </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Play/Pause</h2>
        <p>The easiest way to <strong>play and pause your audio file(s) is to use your <kbd>Spacebar</kbd></strong>. You can also use the buttons found within the top-left area of your Audacity interface.</p>
        <p>To play specific parts of your project, use the <strong>Selection Tool</strong> to click on any part of a clip you'd like to begin playing OR click and drag to highlight a section of any clip to play back.</p>


        <div class="tool-reference">
            <h3>Selection Tool</h3>
            <img src="images/icon-selection.png" alt="selection tool icon">
            <p>The default tool of Audacity. Use it to select, or highlight, any part of the audio to edit it.</p>
            <div class="center-text">
                <img class="center-text" src="images/importing-select.png" alt="image of selecting part of an audio">
            </div>
            <p>The light blue area shows that this audio has been selected with the Selection Tool. You can hit <strong>spacebar</strong> or click the <strong>Play Button</strong> to play the highlighted section.</p>
            <p>To select an entire clip, double click on the clip with the Selection Tool.</p>
            <p>To select all clips within a single track, click the blue "Select" button from the left side of the track.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="good-to-know center">
            <h2>Can't hear your audio?</h2>
            <p>If you're using headphones (especially bluetooth) and can't hear your audio, make sure your device has been detected by Audacity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Go to <strong>Transport > Rescan Audio Devices</strong>
                </li>
                <li>If on a Windows device, go to <strong>File > Preferences...</strong>. If on a Mac device, go to <strong>Audacity > Preferences...</strong></li>
                <li>Within the "Devices" section, make sure your "Playback" device is set to your headphones.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Zoom In/Out</h2>
        <p>When working on an Audacity project, it may be helpful to zoom in and out of a clip to make more detailed edits!</p>
        <div class="tool-reference">
            <h3>Magnification Tools</h3>
            <img src="images/icon-magnification.png" alt="magnification tool icon">
            <p>Use to zoom in and out on wave forms. To zoom in, click on the waveform. Repeat procedure to zoom out. </p>
            <div class="center-text">
                <img src="images/magnification-tool-in-use.gif" alt="gif of magnification tool in use">
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="good-to-know center">

            <h3>View Fit Tool</h3>
            <img src="images/importing-fit.png" alt="view fit tool icon">
            <p>Did you accidently zoom in or out too much? Press the <strong>View Fit Tool</strong> icon and Audacity will automatically rescale your entire audio file(s) to fit your project window.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Basic Edits</h2>
        <h3>Moving Clips</h3>
        <p>To move a clip, simply click on the most top part of a clip (where the name appears) and drag it where you need to. No specific tool has to be selected to be able to move a clip.</p>
        <p>Know that you can move clips between tracks! Not sure what a track is? Read further below to learn more about how to add and remove them!</p>

        <img class="center" src="images/move.gif" alt="a gif showing how to move a clip within and between tracks">

        <div class="good-to-know center">
            <h3>Is your clip not moving?</h3>
            <p>Clips will only move if they are not being "blocked" by other clips. Either move surrounding clips or zoom out enough to reveal the open spaces to move your clip to.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Trimming a Clip</h3>
        <p>Sometimes we need to shorten (trim) the length of an audio clip.</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>Select the <strong>Selection Tool</strong></li>
            <li>Hover over an end of a clip until you see a double arrow</li>
            <li>Click and drag to shorten a clip to your liking</li>
            <li>If you trimmed your clip too much, drag the opposite way to reveal the parts you removed</li>
        </ol>
        <img class="center" src="images/trim.gif" alt="gif showing how to trim an audio clip">

        <h3>Duplicate</h3>
        <p>This option allows a selected audio to be copied onto a new track within a project.</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                Select the audio clip or highlight the section you want to duplicate
            </li>
            <li>Go to <strong>Edit > Duplicate</strong> </li>
            <li>Move your duplicated clip as needed</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Splitting Clips (Making Cuts)</h3>
        <p>We mentioned already that you can use the Selection Tool to play specific parts of a clip. You can also use the same selection method to make cuts and split your clip. Splitting clips is helpful as it allows you to create new sections of audio that you can move around or make copies of as needed.</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>Use the Selection Tool to highlight the section you want to split</li>
            <li>Go to <strong>Edit > Audio Clips > Split</strong></li>
        </ol>

        <img class="center full-width" src="images/split.gif" alt="gif showing how to split an audio clip">
        <p>After splitting a clip, you can also delete this new section. Read below to learn how!</p>

        <h3>Joining Clips</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight-type">Edit > Audio Clips > <strong>Join</strong>:</span> Groups seperate audio clips on the same track into one continuous clip. Use the Selection Tool to highlight multiple clips and then click Join. Notice that Audacity will connect the two clips by adding a duration of complete silence. You can drag the audio clips to join each other to avoid any complete silence.
            <img src="images/editing-clipboundaries-join.gif" alt="gif showing how to select audio and join them into one clip">
        </p>

        <h3>Deleting Parts of a Clip</h3>
        <p>There are two ways to delete parts of a clip. The first method is best practice with a couple of steps, and the second method is a bit faster.</p>
        <p>The best practice method to delete a part of a clip is to first <strong>split the section you want to remove</strong>. Doing this first will ensure you are doing <strong>non-destructive editing</strong> which means you can bring back your deleted section in the future if you need it by dragging the edges of the remaining clips! </p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>Highlight the section you want to remove and split it (refer to the steps above on how to split a clip)</li>
            <li>Click on the most top part of the splitted clip (where the clip name is located) to select the entire clip</li>
            <li>Hit the <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key</li>
        </ol>
        <img class="center" src="images/delete.gif" alt="gif showing how to delete an audio clip">

        <p>A faster way to delete parts of a clip is by using the <strong>Selection Tool</strong> to highlight the area of the part you want to erase and click on the <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key</p>
        <div class="good-to-know center">
            <p>This method of deleting, while very efficient in the moment, is considered to be <strong>destructive editing</strong>. This means that whatever you delete using this method is permanently deleted and cannot be brought back later on.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Fade In/Out</h3>
        <p>It's often a good idea to fade in and fade out audio (such as background music) rather than just have it start or end abruptly within a project.</p>
        <div class="tool-reference">
            <h3>Envelope Tool</h3>
            <img src="images/icon-fade.png" alt="fade tool icon">
            <p>Use the Envelope Tool to adjust the sound level of your audio at different parts. Click anywhere once on the audio to reveal four dots on the waveform. Click once more elsewhere to create more dots and drag the points to adjust the sound level as shown by the wavelength. Make as many points as you need.</p>
            <img src="images/fade-in.gif" alt="example of how to use the fade in tool to adjust volume">
            <p>To adjust the sound of your entire clip, either only make one click and drag downwards as needed OR use the Amplify effect explained further down this manual.</p>
            <p>To undo any point, either press <kbd>Command Z</kbd> or <kbd>Control Z</kbd>, or manually drag each point <em>outside</em> the track to reset.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Add/Remove Tracks</h3>
        <p>Tracks allow for us to essentially "layer" different audio files. For example, tracks can be helpful to layer a voiceover with some background music and occasional sound effects.</p>
        <p>By default, a new track will be created every time you import a new audio file. But if you need to add another track manually, you can go to <strong>Tracks > Add New > Mono Track</strong>. You can choose a Stereo track, but Mono is Audacity's preferred type.</p>
        <img class="center" src="images/add-new-track.png" alt="screenshot showing how to add  a new track">
        <p>To remove a track, simply click on the small "x" on the most top-left corner of the track</p>
        <img class="center" src="images/x-close.png" alt="screenshot of the 'x' to close a track">
        <div class="good-to-know center">
            <h3>Need to Rename a Track?</h3>
            <p>Renaming a track can be helpful to organize your project a bit more. By default, your track will be named after the first imported audio. To rename, click on the down arrow next to the current name and select <strong>"Name..."</strong>.</p>
            <img src="images/rename-track.png" alt="screenshot of menu that appears from clicking on the down arrow of a track">
        </div>

        <h3>Mute/Solo Tracks</h3>
        <p>Sometimes it's helpful to only listen to one track within a project at a time while making edits. Click on <strong>"Mute"</strong> to silence that selected track or <strong>"Solo"</strong> to silence all other tracks.</p>
        <img class="center" src="images/mute-solo.png" alt="mute and solo options within a track">
        <p>Notice how tracks that become greyed out are tracks that have been silenced.</p>


        <div class="important full-width">
            <h3>In-Class Activity #2:</h3>
            <p>Our first activity focused on random edits to get familiar with the program layout and basic tools. For this activity, let's pretend we are assembling a very simple podcast intro. Our project needs the following tasks completed:</p>
            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>Delete the track labeled <strong>Audacity-info</strong></li>
                <li>Import <strong>melodyloops-season-of-joy.mp3</strong> and <strong>voiceover.wav</strong></li>
                <li>Move the voiceover audio a bit to the right so we only hear the background music in the first few seconds of the project.</li>
                <li>The background music is loud! Adjust the overall volume to be softer (tip: Use the Amplify Effect explained further below for this)</li>
                <li>The voiceover is too soft! Adjust the overall volume to be louder (tip: Use the Amplify Effect explained further below for this)</li>
                <li>Fade the background music in at the beginning and out (using the Envelope Tool) before you hear the voiceover.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>Essential Audio Effects</h2>
        <p>The following audio effects may be the most helpful</p>
        <h3>Amplify</h3>
        <p>While the Envelope Tool is helpful to fade audio in and out, it's often easier to adjust the volume of an entire clip with the Amplify effect. This effect also allows you to increase or decrease the volume of a clip at greater levels.</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>Highlight the clip or select the area you want to apply the Amplify effect to </li>
            <li>
                Go to <strong>Effect > Volume and Compression > Amplify</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Select an amount (in decibals) to decrease or increase the volume of the clip.</li>
            <li>Use the "Preview" button to hear the volume levels. Note that both the Preview and OK buttons will be greyed out if the levels are too high unless you check the "Allow clipping" box. We do not recommend this, however, as parts of your audio will become distorted after it's reached its clipping limits.</li>
            <li>Once satisfied with the volume levels, click "OK".</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Loudness Normalization</h3>
        <p>Sometimes our audio clips are all at different volumes and we need to match their loudness to one another. For instance, during an interview with multiple people, we may have one interviewee speak at a volume that is a bit too loud, while another interviewee is a bit more softspoken. For a podcast, this kind of variation in volumes between speakers can be distracting. It would be best to match the loudness with the Loudness Normalization effect.</p>
        <div class="good-to-know center">
            <h3>Normalize Loudness Right Away</h3>
            <p>Before doing any other kind of edits, it's a good idea to normalize (match) the loudness between all the audio clips that need it at the very beginning of your project. This will ensure that other edits go smoothly.</p>
        </div>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li><strong>Select the entire tracks</strong> that have the audio clips that need to be "normalized" by using the "Select" button on the bottom-left corner of each track. Remember to use <kbd>Command</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd> to select more than one track</li>
            <li>Go to <strong>Effect > Volume and Compression > "Loudness Normalization..." </strong></li>
            <li>From the pop-up menu, use the default settings (recommended) or adjust the LUFS to a number of your liking.</li>
            <li>Click OK</li>
            <li>Notice how your volumes between clips are now the same!</li>
            <li>Optional: Use the Amplify effect as needed after you normalize the loudness.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Noise Reduction</h3>
        <p>While it depends on the kind of project, it is often best practice to record in a quiet indoor space away from audible distractions. However, it's not always possible to get a studio-level recording space for every project. More often than not, there will be a constant <em>hum</em> in the background (think refrigerator, ambiant noise, random neighbors laughing at a distance). The Noise Reduction Effect will do it's best to remove as much of that background noise to make your project sound more professional.</p>

            <h3>When It's Best to Just Re-Record</h3>
            <p>While it would be lovely if the Noise Reduction effect could remove all loud background interruptions (traffic, wind, talking), this effect still has some limitations.</p>
            <p>If too much of this effect is added to try to remove some background noise, your main audio will become distorted and much more distracting.</p>
            <p>If at all possible, sometimes it's best to just re-record your audio in a less chaotic environment.</p>

        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p>Record your own audio, or import the <strong>noise-reduction.wav</strong> file from the downloaded Class Files into your project</p>

            <li>
                <p>Use the <strong>Selection Tool</strong> to highlight some "empty" space between words within the recorded speech. This selection will be the reference point for Audacity to know what noise to filter out once we apply the effect.</p>

        <h1>Recording Audio</h1>
        <p>Another way to gather audio is to record it yourself directly in Audacity. To do this, make sure you have access to a <strong>computer with an internal microphone (most laptops have one)</strong> or an <strong>external microphone</strong>.</p>

        <div class="important center full-width">
            <h3>In-Class Activity #3</h3>
            <p>For this third activity, use the effects learned above and the recording section below to complete the following tasks:</p>
            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>Close all existing tracks within your project</li>
                <li>Create a new track and record yourself at a normal voice level</li>
                <li>Create another new track and solo it. On this new track, record yourself at a softer voice level</li>
                <li>Move the second recording to the right so it doesn't overlap with your first recording</li>
                <li>Un-solo the second track</li>
                <li>Select both tracks using the "Select" button on the bottom-left corner of each track. Remember to use <kbd>Command</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd>) to select more than one track</li>
                <li>Use the "Loudness Normalization..." effect to match the volume of both clips.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>First, test your microphone level</h2>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p> Find the <strong>microphone icon </strong> at the top right of the interface, and click <strong>Start Monitoring</strong>. </p>

                </div>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Speak in your normal speaking voice</strong> to test the level, make sure your sound level locates at about <strong>-6 dB</strong>. This level helps prevent audio to go over 0 dB which often results in audio distortion, something that cannot be fixed in post production
            </li>

            <li>
                <p> If your mic level is too low or too high, or cannot see the shifting green bar, you can change your voice volume, or adjust the microphone sensibilit on the top left.</p>

            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Start Recording</h2>
        <p>Choose the type of the microphone you want to use for recording. In this case, I am using the internal microphone directly from my laptop.</p>

        <h1>Saving and Exporting</h1>
        <p>When you finish working with your audio files, you have several options for saving and exporting your files. </p>

        <h2>Save as Audacity Project</h2>
        <div class="side-image-large "> <img src="images/saving-audacityproject.png " alt="image of file > save project as..."> </div>
        <p>Saving as an Audacity project allows you to open the project later and add further changes to your audio. The information of your multiple tracks will be saved into the project. This is the best option if you want to <strong>continue editing in Audacity</strong>. Note that this project is only compatible with Audacity, meaning you won't be able to share your creation with people who don't have Audacity downloaded onto the computer they want to open your project from.</p>

        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                Go to <span class="highlight-type">File > <strong>Save Project...</strong></span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Choose a folder</strong> to save your project in. The default folder is named Audacity and is usually placed under Documents.
            </li>
            <li>
                Give your project an appropriate <strong>File Name</strong> so that it is easier to locate later in case you forget the folder it's saved in.
            </li>
            <li>
                Click <strong>Save</strong> to save your project as a <span class="highlight-type">.aup</span> file</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Export as MP3 File</h2>
        <p>If you want your audio files to have <strong>relatively good quality</strong> and <strong>smaller file size</strong>, export your audio as a <span class="highlight-type"> .mp3 </span> file. This is often the most popular kind of file to export as!
            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>
                    Go to <span class="highlight-type">File > Export > <strong>Export as MP3</strong></span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Choose a folder</strong> to save your project in. The default folder is named Audacity and is usually placed under Documents.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Give your project an appropriate <strong>File Name</strong> so that it is easier to locate later in case you forget the folder it's saved in.
                </li>
                <li>For the <strong>Format Options</strong>, usually the default will do the job</li>
                <li> Audacity will prompt you to enter <strong>metadata</strong> for the audio. Complete the form to the best of your ability and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="centered-image-large "> <img src="images/exporting-Metadata.png " alt="wav file exporting metadeta form"> </div>

            <h2>Export as WAV File</h2>
            <img class="side-image-large " src="images/exporting-wav.PNG" alt="image of file > export > export as wav">
            <p>If you want to export your file to a compatible format, and you want to keep the <strong>best quality</strong> of your audio, export your audio as <span class="highlight-type"> .wav </span> (Waveform Audio File Format) file format. This file format is commonly used for uncompressed audio files and is <strong>compatible with most media players</strong>. It is also a <strong>larger file size </strong>compared to other formats.</p>

            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>
                    Go to <span class="highlight-type">File > Export > <strong>Export as WAV</strong></span>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Give your project an appropriate <strong>File Name</strong> so that it is easier to locate later in case you forget the folder it's saved in.
                </li>
                <li>Choose <strong>Save as type</strong> as either <span class="highlight">WAV (Microsoft) signed 16-bit PCM</span> or <span class="highlight">WAV (Microsoft) signed 32-bit Float PCM</span> and click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
                <li> Audacity will prompt you to enter <strong>metadata</strong> for the audio. Complete the form to the best of your ability and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>

        <h1>Optional Audio Effects (Only if Time Allows)</h1>
        <div class="important center full-width">
            <h3>Class Activity #5 (Only if Time Allows)</h3>
            <p>If there is extra time left in class, feel free to go over this section which describes extra effects. If there is not enough time left, this section can be reviewed by each student after class if needed at their own pace.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Auto Duck</h2>
        <p>Auto Duck is an especially useful effect for podcasting. The effect reduces (ducks) the volume of one or more selected tracks automatically whenever the volume of a single unselected "control track " placed underneath reaches a particular threshold level. For example, you can have the volume of the track with background music reduce once the track with a voiceover is introduced at a certain volume.</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list ">
            <li>
                <p>Import the music file <span class="highlight-type"><strong>melodyloops-season-of-joy.mp3</strong></span> and <span class="highlight-type"><strong>voiceover.wav</strong></span> file. Make sure the music file is on the track above the track of the voiceover file. If not, click on the <strong>small triangle next to the audio name</strong>, and choose <em>Move Track Down</em></p>
                <img src="images/move-track-down.gif" alt="gif showing how to move a track below another one">
            </li>
            <li>
                Using the <strong>Selection Tool</strong>, highlight the entire music file and go to <span class="highlight-type">Effect > Volume and Compression > <strong>Auto Duck</strong></span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Adjust the <strong>Duck amount</strong> and <strong>outer and inner fade up/fade down length</strong>. The lower the dB of the <strong>Duck amount</strong>, the lower the volume of the music will be once the voiceover appears. The <strong>Outer fade down/up length</strong> is the amount of time it takes to gradually fade the music out or in before the voice audio enters. The inner fade down/up length is the amount of time given to continue the fade after the voice audio enters. Remeber to always <strong>Preview</strong> your edits before clicking OK.</p>
                <img src="images/effect-autoduck.png" alt="auto duck dialogue box with editing options">
            </li>
            <li>
                Press <strong>OK</strong> once you're done. Below is an example of a music file before and after the Auto Duck Effect:
            </li>
        </ol>

        <img src=images/effect-adafter.png alt="image of audio wavelength after auto duck effect added">


        <h2>More Audio Effects</h2>
        <p>Audacity includes many audio effects for more advanced audio editing. To apply an effect, first use the <strong>Selection Tool</strong> to highlight the area of the audio you want to modify. Then, from the <strong>Effect</strong> menu, select an effect option to add to the selected audio.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight-type">Effect > Pitch and Tempo > <strong>Change Speed...</strong></span>: Increases or decreases the speed of the selected audio , affecting the pitch in the process </li>
            <li><span class="highlight-type">Effect > Pitch and Tempo > <strong>Change Pitch...</strong></span>: Changes the degree of highness or lowness of the tone in the selected audio</li>
            <li><span class="highlight-type">Effect > Pitch and Tempo >  <strong>Change Tempo...</strong></span>: Changes the speed at which the selected audio is played without affecting the pitch</li>
            <li><span class="highlight-type">Effect > Fading > <strong>Fade In/Fade Out...</strong></span>: In addition to the Fade Tool, you can also use this effect to automatically fade the audio</li>
        </ul>
